## Vidio Link: phase 2 Portfolio project

- I am going to explin to choose vacation package with user budget using Sinatra App starts with a homepage of Sinatra-Vacation_project. The new users have to sign in before login.

- From homepage the new user can sign in with name, username, email, and password. Then the user has to login to create a vacation package.

- When the user signup, if the blank input the app gives an error message. When the user login input not correct the
